#A good first program 
print("Hello World")
print("Hello World Again")
print('I like typing this')
print("This is fun")
print('Yay! Printing')
print("I'd much rather you 'not'.")
print('I "said" do not touch this.')

# This excercise shows what the print function does
# print() prints a messae to the console, does not display to the screen.
